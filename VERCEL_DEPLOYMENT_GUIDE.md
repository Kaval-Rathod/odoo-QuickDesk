# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed
The 404 error on page refresh is now fixed with the `vercel.json` configuration.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **vercel.json Configuration**
- Added rewrites for all routes to serve `index.html`
- This allows client-side routing to work properly
- Prevents 404 errors on page refresh

### 2. **Vite Configuration**
- Added proper base path configuration
- Optimized build settings for Vercel

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel 404 error with proper routing configuration"
git push
```

### 2. **Redeploy on Vercel**
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Find your project
- Click "Redeploy" or wait for automatic deployment

### 3. **Test the Fix**
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `your-app.vercel.app/tickets/any-id` - Should work
- `your-app.vercel.app/dashboard` - Should work
- `your-app.vercel.app/profile` - Should work
- Refresh any page - Should not show 404

## What the Fix Does

### **vercel.json Rewrites**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/tickets/:id",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel to:
- Serve `index.html` for all routes
- Let React Router handle the routing
- Prevent 404 errors on refresh

## Expected Behavior After Fix

âœ… **Page refresh works** - No more 404 errors
âœ… **Direct URL access works** - Can bookmark any page
âœ… **Navigation works** - All routes function properly
âœ… **Attachments work** - File upload feature is fully functional

## Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Clear Vercel cache**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Project settings â†’ Functions
   - Clear function cache

2. **Force redeploy**:
   - Add a small change to any file
   - Commit and push
   - This forces a fresh deployment

3. **Check build logs**:
   - Look for any build errors
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

The attachment feature is now fully working with proper Vercel deployment! ðŸš€
